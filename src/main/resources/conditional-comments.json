However, this combination of DRMs greatly increases the risk of emergent high-level ETV resistance. Other less common mutations at this position include L180FYR."

A181T causes a stop codon in the S protein reading frame, potentially allowing for ongoing hepatic replication without accompanying plasma viral load rebound. A181VT also occasionally arises in patients receiving 3TC and reduces susceptibility to this drug as well. It causes little, if any, cross-resistance to TDF and TAF.  A181SGC are uncommon mutations at this position."
